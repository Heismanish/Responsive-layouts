Learning repsonsive layouts with kevin powell

## Use Percentages:
- Giving width in percentages keeps the layout responsive.
- Percentage given to a child is actually that percent  of the parent, i.e., if width of a hild is 80% then it's 80% of the parent. 

## NOTE: Web is responsive by default, it's our css that makes it non responsive.

## Avoid Heights:
- Heights can cause child to overflow vertically so avoid giving heights to the parent.
